# Reproducing Roeth and Tarantola using Modern Tools - Blog Series

This repository holds the code used to build the blog series around
the seminal work of Roeth and Tarantola 1994.
The blog is hosted on my [website](https://lukasmosser.github.io).

The first part of the series covers the creation of a generative model 
using Pytorch distributions to create layered earth models.

## Planned Blog Posts

- Part 1: [Layered Earth Generative Modeling with Pytorch](https://github.com/LukasMosser/roeth_tarantola_blog_series/blob/master/Roeth%20and%20Tarantola%20Reloaded%20-%20Part%201-Data%20Generation.ipynb)
- Part 2: [Synthetic Waveform Modelling using Devito](https://github.com/LukasMosser/roeth_tarantola_blog_series/blob/master/Roeth%20and%20Tarantola%20Reloaded%20-%20Part%202-Seismic%20Forward%20Modeling.ipynb)
- Part 3: Training Neural Networks to perform inversion using Pytorch
- Part 4: Roeth, Tarantola and beyond...

Stay tuned!
